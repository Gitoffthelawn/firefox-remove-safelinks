## [Unreleased]

## [1.10.0] - 2024-02-12
### Added
- Added options UI for testing an URL against the regular expressions
- Added example for regular expressions, in order to make it easier to get started

## [1.9.0] - 2024-02-07
### Added

## Changed
- Migrated background script to be non-persistent (in preparation for Manifest V3)

## [1.8.0] - 2024-11-02
Due to issues with the changes that have been introduced with 1.7.0 (see GitHub issues),
I have decided to revert the corresponding changes for now, as our privacy
is more important than the features that have been added.

If you have experience with Firefox Add-On development (and especially Manifest V3 and
background scripts), please do not hesitate to reach out and help on GitHub.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for any inconvenience!
